## Computer Graphics Algorithms

Computer graphic are pictures and films created using computers. Usually, the term refers to computer-generated image data created with the help of specialized graphical hardware and software. It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world.
